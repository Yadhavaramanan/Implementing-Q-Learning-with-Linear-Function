# Implementing-Q-Learning-with-Linear-Function
n this Q-learning implementation, a grid world environment is defined with 16 states, and agents can take 4 possible actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to reach state 15. The Q-table, initialized with zeros, serves as a memory to store Q-values for state-action pairs.
